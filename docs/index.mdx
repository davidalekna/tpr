> React Components is a design system for TPR

React components are maintained following a multi-package approach where
components are packaged and published individually, but combined under this
single repository.

## Installation

See the individual package README for the React component you would like
to install.

| Packages     |
| ------------ |
| @tpr/core    |
| @tpr/forms   |
| @tpr/table   |
| @tpr/icons   |
| @tpr/theming |

## Usage

React Components packages are ready to use in a
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) environment or together
with standard Rollup or webpack build configurations.

Here is a simple example to get you started:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ThemeProvider from '@tpr/theming';
import { Button } from '@tpr/core';

const App = () => (
	/* Include a ThemeProvider wrapper at the root of your app */
	<ThemeProvider>
		<Button>Example React button</Button>
	</ThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
